1. How to run my program
   1) Run client and server in two different student.cs machines
      a) I have tested my program on both ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca and
         ubuntu1204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca machines.
      b) Run my server.sh in one of the host(002 or 004). Simply type "./server.sh <request_code>".
         <request_code> can be anything. It can be a string or an integer.
         Now you shall see the server outputs "SERVER_PORT=<n_port>"
      c) Run my client.sh on the other host. Simply type "./client.sh <server_address> <n_port> <request_code> <message>"
         The <server_address> is either "ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca" or "ubuntu1204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca"
         depends on where the server runs. The <n_port> is the output n_port by server. The <message> is whatever message you input.
         Remember to enclose the message within double quotes if it contains white spaces. For example, "My name is Jack".
      d) Now you shall see the terminals output
         "Server received message: XXXXX"
         "Client received reversed message: XXXXX"
   2) Run both client and server in a single student.cs machine
      a) I have my programm tested on both ubuntu1204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca and
         ubuntu1204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca machines.
      b) First, to run my server. Simply type "./server.sh <request_code> &" in
         The "&" allows the server to run in the background.
         Now you will see the server outputs "SERVER_PORT=<n_port>".
      c) Second, to run my client. Simply type "./client.sh localhost <n_port> <request_code> <message>"
         in the same terminal. Use the n_port and request_code from part b).
      d) Now, you will see the terminal outputs:
         "Server received message: XXXXX"
         "Client received reversed message: XXXXX"
